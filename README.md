# MLP-classifier
Using Multi Layered Perceptron (MLP) neural network for “Iris” and “Glass” datasets to study the effect of number of neurons in
the hidden layer, number of hidden layers, on classification performance.

# Analysing the effect of number of neurons in hidden layers on train and test sets for Iris dataset  
the star signs corresponds to test-set and the plus signs corresponds to the training-set
